Usertext
========

This plugin adds a bunch of helpers, the most important of which is usertext(), which takes user-inputted text and marks it up with HTML and appropriate typographic characters.

The plugin's homepage is here: http://code.google.com/p/usertext/

Example
=======

For example, the following string:

"Hello world! This is an amazing plugin because...

* it's smart
* it's lightweight
* it's easy to customise"

would be transformed into:

"<p>Hello world! This is an amazing plugin because…</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s smart</li>
<li>it’s lightweight</li>
<li>it’s easy to customise</li>
</ul>"
